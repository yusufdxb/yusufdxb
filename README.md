# Yusuf Guenena

Robotics & Embedded Systems Engineer  
Autonomous • Assistive • Medical Robotics  

M.S. Robotics Engineering (Intelligent Control) — Wayne State University

I build **end-to-end robotic systems** that tightly integrate perception, control, embedded electronics, and real hardware, with a focus on **safety-critical and assistive applications**.

## 🔧 What I Build

I design and prototype **real-world robotic systems**, not simulations only. My work emphasizes:

- Perception, control, and human–robot interaction  
- ROS 2 (Humble / Jazzy) system integration  
- Embedded electronics & sensor fusion  
- Hardware–software co-design  

My interests center on **medical robotics, assistive autonomy, and intelligent systems**.

## 🚀 Flagship Projects

### 🦮 GO2 Seeing-Eye Dog (Research Project)

Assistive robotics prototype using **ROS 2**, onboard perception, and multimodal human–robot interaction.  
Focused on real-world navigation and guidance for visually impaired users.
ROS 2–based autonomy, perception, and interaction framework for assistive navigation using Unitree GO2, targeting safe and intuitive mobility for visually impaired users.

This project constitutes a Master’s thesis centered on multimodal human–robot interaction and safety-critical perception for assistive robotics. The core research investigates audio-visual grounding for human intent inference, where a user issues a spoken command (e.g., “come here”), the robot performs audio perception and sound-source localization, orients toward the acoustic cue, executes vision-based human identification, confirms user intent, and subsequently performs human-aware, safety-constrained navigation toward the caller.

Primary research themes include:
- Audio perception and sound-source localization for user-driven interaction
- Audio-guided visual attention and human identification
- Multimodal intent grounding and interaction confidence modeling
- Safety-critical scene perception (stairs, curbs, doors, narrow passages, dynamic obstacles)
- Human-aware navigation and conservative assistive behaviors

**Status:** Active research and development (ROS 2 stack integration and experimental validation in progress).
